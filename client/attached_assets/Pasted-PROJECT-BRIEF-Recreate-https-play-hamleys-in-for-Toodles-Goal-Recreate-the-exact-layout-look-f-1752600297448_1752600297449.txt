PROJECT BRIEF: Recreate https://play.hamleys.in for Toodles
Goal: Recreate the exact layout, look, feel, and functionality of https://play.hamleys.in for our indoor kids play zone business — https://toodlesfunzone.com

UI/UX Cloning

Use the same layout, flow, and component structure as https://play.hamleys.in — including homepage design, booking section, navigation, contact, and experience pages.

Must be fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Customization for Toodles

Replace Hamleys branding, colors, and imagery with Toodles theme — colorful, fun, and soft-play-focused (you can use https://toodlesfunzone.com/ for theme reference).

Update copy/content/images as per Toodles offerings.
